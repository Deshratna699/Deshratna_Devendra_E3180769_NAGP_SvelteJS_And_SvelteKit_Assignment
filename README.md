    ```

## Running the Project

To start the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to view the application.

## Features

1. **Nested Routes for Tasks:**
   - View all tasks: `/tasks/all`
   - View tasks by category: `/tasks/category/[category]`
   - View task details: `/tasks/[id]`

2. **Category Filter:**
   - Filter tasks by category.

3. **User Profile:**
   - Display user information.

4. **Task Filtering and Sorting:**
   - Filter by category, due date, and status.
   - Sort tasks by date and priority.

## State Management

### Task Store

The task state is managed in `src/stores/tasks.js`. Use Svelte stores to handle task data including methods for adding, updating, deleting, and fetching tasks.

### User Store

Manage user authentication state and data in `src/stores/user.js` using Svelte stores. Implement methods for user login, registration, and logout.

## Advanced Routing

### Dynamic Parameters and Layouts

Implement dynamic parameters for task detail pages and utilize layouts to maintain a consistent structure across nested routes.

### Protected Routes

Create a protected route for authenticated users to manage tasks (`/tasks`). Handle unauthorized access gracefully.

### Error Handling

Implement custom error pages for 404 errors and handle routing errors within the application.

## API Interaction

### Backend API Setup

(Optional) Set up a backend API using Node.js/Express or your preferred framework for managing tasks and user data. Alternatively, use a mock API service like JSONPlaceholder.

### Fetching Data from API

Implement API calls to fetch tasks and user data. Utilize SvelteKit's `load` function to prefetch data for routes.

### User Authentication

Implement user authentication using JWT or session-based methods. Use Svelte stores to manage authentication state, and create secure login and registration forms.

## Enhancements and Optimization

### Task Filtering and Sorting

Enhance task management with advanced filtering by category, due date, and status. Implement sorting options by date and priority.

### Responsive Design

Ensure the application is fully responsive and provides an optimal user experience across devices and screen sizes.

### Performance Optimization

Optimize Svelte components and stores for better performance. Implement lazy loading for components and routes where appropriate.
